## Is it cold out?

Going to create a simple app where you are asked to set your preferences about the weather and every day it will tell you if the weather is cold or not based on your preference.




3/11/22
    set pref. 
    then if location is not set it will ask to set location after submit. 
    through the mounting of show weather.
    that data is set in the state as data.

    now need to use localStorage to compare the values for their locations.
    make sure if your local storage is set but location isnt it still asks.
    find a way to not track location?? set location?
